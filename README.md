# docker-compose-gradle-plugin
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/avast/docker-compose-gradle-plugin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/avast/docker-compose-gradle-plugin) [![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/avast/maven/docker-compose-gradle-plugin/images/download.svg) ](https://bintray.com/avast/maven/docker-compose-gradle-plugin/_latestVersion)

Simplifies usage of [Docker Compose](https://www.docker.com/docker-compose) for local development and integration testing in [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) environment.

`composeUp` task starts the application and waits till all exported TCP ports are open (so till the application is ready). Then it exposes assigned host and ports of particular containers in `dockerCompose.servicesInfos` property.

`composeDown` task stops the application and removes the containers.

# Usage
The plugin must be applied on project that contains `docker-compose.yml` file. It supposses that [Docker Engine](https://www.docker.com/docker-engine) and [Docker Compose](https://www.docker.com/docker-compose) are installed and available in `PATH`.

```gradle
buildscript {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath "com.avast.gradle:docker-compose-gradle-plugin:$versionHere"
    }
}

apply plugin: 'java'
apply plugin: 'docker-compose'

dockerCompose.isRequiredBy(test) // hooks 'dependsOn composeUp' and 'finalizedBy composeDown'

dockerCompose {
    // stopContainers = false // useful for debugging
}

test.doFirst {
    // get information about container of service 'web' (declared in docker-compose.yml)
    def webInfo = dockerCompose.servicesInfos.web
    // pass host and exposed TCP port 80 as Java System properties
    systemProperty 'myweb.host', webInfo.host
    systemProperty 'myweb.port', webInfo.ports[80]
    // exposes "WEB_HOST" and "WEB_TCP_80" environment variables
    dockerCompose.exposeAsEnvironment(test)
    // exposes "web.host" and "web.host.80" system properties
    dockerCompose.exposeAsSystemProperties(test)
}
```

# Tips 
* `dockerCompose.servicesInfos` contains information about running containers so you must access this property after `composeUp` task is finished. So `doFirst` of your test task is perfect place where to access it.
* If some Dockerfile needs a artifact generated by Gradle then you can declare this dependency in standard way, like `composeUp.dependsOn project(':my-app').distTar`
* You can call `dockerCompose.isRequiredBy(anyTask)` for any task, for example for your custom `integrationTest` task.
* All properties in `dockerCompose` have meaningfull default values so you don't have to touch it. If you are interested then you can look at [ComposeExtension.groovy](/src/main/groovy/com/avast/gradle/dockercompose/ComposeExtension.groovy) for reference.
* It's recommended not to assign fixed forwarded ports in `docker-compose.yml` for automated build because it can cause ports collision on integration server.
